# Example project for analyzing tandem repeats with TRAL

Scripts to detect, score, filter and refine tandem repeats in biological sequences are provided in the 'scripts' folder.
This example project is mainly intended to be used in containers generated from the TRAL docker image provided [here](https://github.com/acg-team/tral/pkgs/container/tral%2Ftral_docker)

An example protein sequence to analyze can be found in the 'data' folder.

For more detailed information on how to run each script, run it with the '--help' flag, e.g.

`python3 scripts/tral_detect --help`
